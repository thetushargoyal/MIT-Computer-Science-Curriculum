# **DIY MIT Computer Science Degree**


## 6-3: Computer Science and Engineering
#


This project was inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo-ctqruwRc) which he took on in 2011 and successful completed all courses<sup>[1]</sup> in under one year, required to get a MIT Degree in Computer Science and Engineering using [MIT's OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) (obviously, for no actual credits). For more information about the challenge out his [website ðŸ¡•](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)


Starting 2022, MIT has changed the requirements for CS undergrads. But as most of the courses remain the same and relevant and it might take some years before MIT start posting content from their new courses starting from 2022, we will lay down complete techincal coursework for the degree from 2017 requirements. 


> *This major covers a wide range of algorithms and theory, software engineering, programming languages, computer systems, human-computer interaction and graphics, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. Students who entered MIT in Fall 2021 or earlier can choose between the 2017 and 2022 requirements. Students entering in Fall 2022 
or later must use the 2022 requirements.*

Over the time, MIT has updated most of the courses and posted the content on several different platforms including:-

- Course Websites
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
- [MIT Open Learning Library](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/dashboard) (previously offered on edX)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

To save someone the trouble of finding the latest courses and understanding the curriculum, I have laid down all the techincal courses from the latest sources in one place. Anyone willing to learn from the best engineering school in the world is welcome to do so for no fees! I have followed some courses personally and I'm sure you will develop a new appreciation for the subject like I did.
